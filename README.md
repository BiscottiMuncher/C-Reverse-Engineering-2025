# C-Reverse-Engineering-2025
A collection of reverse engineering challenges that I wrote, some easier than others, updated every so often when I write another one. 

## Project Breakdown
**C Executables**
- Precompiled C binaries (All source code in **C Source**)

**C Source**
- Source code for the executables, I would recommend trying to reverse engineer the files before looking at the source (But I cant stop you)

**Write Ups** 
- Write ups, with guides on how to reverse engineer the executables, images, witty comments and more found within. 

--- 
I wrote all of these while I was starting to just learn C (for the 4th or 5th time) please excuse any improper syntax, unfreed malloc, or misuse of pointers.
